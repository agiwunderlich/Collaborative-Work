# Collaborative-Work

## Kreativstorm Projects
These were three collaborative projects conducted within the framework of a training program organized by the Berlin-based company, Kreativstorm. This program provided us with an environment that allowed us to gain insight into the workings of a development team. Throughout these projects, I acquired valuable knowledge about the significance of version control, the practice of assertive communication, and the dynamics of teamwork.
